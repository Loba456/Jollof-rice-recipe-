  <!-- A small info about Jollof rice -->
  <p>
    Jollof rice is a dish with deep roots in West African culture, 
    and it's one that carries with it a sense <br> community,celebration, 
    and tradition. In my household, this recipe has always been a staple,
    passed <br> down from my Nigerian mum who has absolutely perfected it. 
    Each pot of this Nigerian jollof rice <br> brings with it the memories of 
    family gatherings and festive occasions, but it's also a comfort food<br> we 
    enjoy on any day of the week.

  <!--Making jollof rice with basmiti rice -->
  </p>
      It's made with <i>basmati rice</i>,which is lighter and fluffier than other types of rice often used in jollof,
      <br> and it always includes <b>DeRicatomato paste</b>—a brand that has been a kitchen mainstay for as long ,<br>
      as I can remember. Whether you're new to jollof rice or just looking to refine your technique, this <br>
      recipe will guide you through the process with ease.You can watch us make it together here!

  <!-- Instructions on how to make jollof rice with bamasti rice -->
  <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>

  <ol>
   <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth.</li>
   <br>
   <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat. Add the<br>
      onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, then add the tomato purée <br>
      and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to darken, 3 to 5 minutes.
   </li>
   <br>
   <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the 
      heat <br> to medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid – it will splatter! Cook,<br>
      stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original <br> volume 
      and the oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water.
      Season <br>generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring 
      to a boil over <br>medium-high heat.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, rinse the rice thoroughly with cold water until the water runs <br>
      clean, then drain. Add the rice to the sauce and stir to combine.<br>
      As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot<br>
      and cook for 25 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through.<br>
      Remove the bay leaves, give the rice a stir and you’re ready to serve, preferably <br>
      with grilled chicken and fried plantain.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>
    <u>Notes</u>
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For a milder jollof, use 1 scotch bonnet. If you’re a bona fide spice king/queen,<br>
      feel free to use 3 or 4.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Jollof rice is a little tricky to master. After the 25 minutes of cooking time, if
      the <br>rice is sauce-logged, take the lid off the pot to cook off any excess moisture. If <br>
      the rice is dry and/or undercooked, stir in 100 ml to 200 ml water, cover and continue <br>to
      steam over low heat.
